                <p>Bekal Fort is a historical structure built in the 17th century and has itself become part of an identity of the district. It is situated in Pallikara village of Kasaragod on a headland that spans up to 35 km.It is believed that the fort was originally constructed by rulers of the ancient Kadampa dynasty and the power changed hands over the years to Kolathiri Rajas, Hyder Ali, Tipu Sultan and finally to the British East India Company. The lofty, circular laterite structure of the fort that stands at a height of 130 feet is shaped like a giant keyhole. The walls around rise to 12 metres in height. The highlights include tall observation towers which presumably would have been occupied by gigantic cannons until a few centuries ago, a water tank with its flight of steps and a tunnel that opens towards the south. The architectural beauty of the fort also met the defence requirements of various rulers,which was the main reason for the fortâ€™s existence. There are also some pilgrim attractions nearby like the Lord Hanuman temple and an old Mosque which is believed to be built by Tippu Sultan.The Bekal beach is only a kilometre away from the fort which offers an enticing view of the imposing fort. It has now become a favoured destination for weddings, ad shoots and filmmakers for its picturesque location. This is the largest and the best-preserved fort in the district and is now maintained by the Archaeological Department of Government of India.</p>

It is believed to be the oldest surviving martial art in India, with a history spanning over 3,000 years.Kalaripayattu is a martial art which developed out of combat-techniques of the 11th-12th century battlefield, with weapons and combative techniques that are unique to Kerala. The word Kalaripayattu is a combination of two Malayalam words - kalari (training ground or battleground) and payattu (training of martial arts), which is roughly translated as "practice in the arts of the battlefield". The name 'Kalari' may also be derived from the Malayalam or Sanskrit term 'Khaloorika,' which is the name of a goddess associated with Shaktism who is worshipped in Kalaripayattu.The Kamika Agama, a 5th century CE South Indian ancient text on Shaiva Siddhanta, discusses the construction of the 'Khaloorika', as place for military exercise.<p>

Bhuta, which means the past or bygone, refers to the spirit of the ancestors and divine powers. There is a belief that the art form is said to be a manifestation of this Bhuta worship just like Theyyam. As Yakshagana is also influenced by folk dance and Sanskrit drama, it cannot be narrowed down into folk, classical or rural forms since it incorporated elements of all of these. The stories performed in Yakshagana are taken from epics like Ramayana, Mahabharata and Bhagavatham. The word Yakshagana can literally be translated to 'music of celestial beings'. The art form imbibes dance, music and also dialogues. With the accompaniment of background music played using percussion instruments like chenda, maddalam, jagatta or chengila and chakratala or elathalam, the story is narrated by the artists and singers. The performances arenâ€™t always time restrained or fixed to the script but are flexible to improvisations. The dance performance and the dialogues depend on the experience and the skill of the artists. The art form has its own unique stage techniques and the performers sport an elaborate and colourful make-up. The costume consists of a headgear, kavacha, armlets and belts covered with golden foil. The language presented is generally Kannada but is also performed in Malayalam and Tulu languages. It was earlier referred to as Bayatala in some places in Karnataka. Some of the art forms in the neighbouring states like the Therukoothu of Tamil Nadu, Kutiyattam and Chakyarkoothu of Kerala and Veedhinataka of Andhra Pradesh are considered sister art forms of Yakshagana.

Thullal texts are written in Malayalam, and the performer follows the text for verses and then creatively adds spontaneous dialogues. There is a participatory nature of communication in Thullal as the performer interacts with the audience and incorporates their expressions and comments to shape the oral version of the play. Face makeup, crowns, and costumes are stylised but the language is simple.hullal has three distinct variations named Sheethangan Thullal, Ottan Thullal, and Parayan Thullal. Each form differs in terms of costume, speed, and slight musical and rhythm variations. Among the three, Ottan Thullal is the fastest version and the most popular one. Although Thullal is known for its satirical statements, the art form is structured with strictly codified movement patterns, footwork, rhythmic variations, gestures, and facial expression techniques. Eye movements, facial expressions, and hand gestures used in Thullal are directly influenced by other art forms like Kathakali and Kutiyattam. The stories are from the Hindu epics, and the actor connects situations and characters with contemporary social events and people. Thullal is widely performed all over Kerala as part of temple festivals, regional festivals, and also at various public festival venues. In the 20th century, as part of institutionalizing traditional performance forms, Thullal received support from the Kerala Kalamandalam. </p>
